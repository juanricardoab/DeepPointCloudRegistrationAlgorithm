<p align="justify">With the continuous development of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques and the increase in applications across various fields of science where this technology can be applied, many methodologies have emerged to solve the problems of registering and aligning point clouds located in random positions or when there is no estimation of the transformation that differentiates them. In this 3D reconstruction process, after scanning or obtaining data from different viewpoints, one of the main challenges is establishing corresponding points between different captures to correctly align that pair of point clouds (integration or registration) based on the same reference system. It is necessary to adjust and align the point clouds corresponding to the scans of the object or scene in question in order to carry out the reconstruction or digitization for whatever its application may be. This research work proposes an algorithm that involves Deep Learning techniques to achieve accurate registration of point clouds captured in environments with occlusion, high reflectance, and missing data.<p/>
